# Contributing to PKHeX-Plugins

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to PKHeX-Plugins development. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

Before contributing, make sure to read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/architdate/PKHeX-Plugins/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for this project. All the rules specified there also apply to making contributions.

PKHeX-Plugins is being used in several different projects such as: 
- A plugin extension to [PKHeX](https://github.com/architdate/PKHeX)
- As a legality checker and fixer for [PKSM](https://github.com/FlagBrew/PKSM) and FlagBrew's [CoreAPI](https://github.com/FlagBrew/CoreAPI)
- In [SysBot.NET](https://github.com/kwsch/SysBot.NET) for generating and injecting Pokemon 
- In [PKHeX Mobile](https://github.com/kwsch/PKHeX.Mobile) for Auto Legality
.. and a few others that I may not know of. Please ensure that an issue or a feature is relevant to this specific repo rather than another repo that may be utilizing these plugins before contributing

### Issues

When submitting an issue, please use an issue template and ensure you are filling things correctly. If you are unsure, you can always ask on our Discord instead (we monitor both locations)!

Have a question? Please contact us on Discord (link on [README.md](https://github.com/architdate/PKHeX-Plugins/blob/master/README.md)) instead. Please be patient when expecting a response; this is free software and we aren't available at all times.

### Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request, please try to have everything ready for merging and passing all tests unless it is a big change and you would prefer to open a Draft request for it. In case of longer draft request, please include a TODO checklist in the original PR message for an initial review of the logic intended and to track progress.

Please make sure your code is maintainable; provide comments and xmldoc when appropriate. If you are coding new GUI features, ensure any non-GUI logic is separate from the GUI specific logic; separating concerns is important for maintainability and portability!

If you are providing something that interacts with game data, try to model things to match the way the game interacts with the data. When done this way, it is easiest for others to replicate your research and expand upon your improvements.

### Forks

Please keep your own forks of this repository opensource as well! We develop these programs to help out the community, please do the same as well and give back to the community.

### Monetary Contributions

This project does not take monetary contributions at the moment because we believe that there are other causes in the world right now that deserve your money more. Please consider donating to a reputable charity instead. Alternatively, if you want to contribute to the tech projects, we recommend any of the ones that use these plugins (stated on top of this file).
